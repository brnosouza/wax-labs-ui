<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Please provide a short description of your team’s experience that is relevant to the project.

<p>Depending on the type of proposal you are submitting, this section will need to be more or less detailed. For example, the milestone deliverables in this template are what is appropriate for an application development project. A proposer that is looking for funding for something more simple, like hosting a meetup will need to provide only a small information, such as what the funds will be used for (venue fee, food, small prize giveaway).</p>
<p>This section is also an excellent area to set any expectations with the Inspector Generals in terms of additional accountability. Proposals that agree to establish additional cadence above and beyond submitting deliverable reports are more likely to be approved. Examples of this could be bi-weekly check-in meetings or weekly written updates.</p>
